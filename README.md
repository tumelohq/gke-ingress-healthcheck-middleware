GKE Ingress Health Check Middleware is a http-middleware package that is designed to be used with the Ingress in GKE on the Google Cloud Platform. The ingress requires the root path of the target to return a 200 (OK) to indicate the service's good health. This can be quite a challenging demand depending on the application's path design. This middleware filters out the requests from the health check and returns the health of the service.
